Got in here to learn Google's Go Languange
Did a bit of C++ before, did not go far

Decided to try a new language after I bought a Learning Package from StackSkills. Hope it's worth it. I'd love to get somewhere interesting this time. Oh well. We'll see. Ultimate objective it's to make a change, somewhere. Hopefully a positive change.
